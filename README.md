## Ade-mir's HTML CSS JavaScript Portfolio Website project
This is a tutorial project built by https://github.com/Ade-mir. 

## Motivation
I followed along with Ade's tutorial to gain knowledge and understanding on how to build a responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to take what I learned in this project and apply it to my own personal portfolio
